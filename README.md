## Overview
This document provides a detailed guide to the IoT-Connected Health App Prototype, an application designed to monitor and track the user's health data using Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The app collects vital health information such as heart rate, temperature, step count, and more, through connected wearable devices or sensors. This data is then analyzed to provide insights into the user’s health status and can be used for preventative care, fitness tracking, and early detection of health issues.

## Features
Health Monitoring: Track heart rate, temperature, steps, sleep, and other vital metrics.
Real-Time Sync: Data is synced instantly from IoT devices to the app.
Notifications: Get alerts for abnormal readings (e.g., high heart rate or temperature spikes).
Historical Data: View trends over time to track your health progress.
User Profiles: Save personal health data for customized recommendations.
Wearable Integration: Works with popular smartwatches and fitness trackers.
